## :pencil: Summary
The project was developed in conjunction with Rocketseat's [Maratona Discover](https://rocketseat.com.br) with the great instructor [Mayk Brito](https://github.com/maykbrito). The real purpose of the project was to put into practice the basic ideas of HTML, CSS, and Javascript and have a pleasant contact with these languages. Along with the development of this project, I completed the [Discover](https://app.rocketseat.com.br/discover) classes to deepen my knowledge. I believe this experience has been of utmost importance in my learning journey as I felt motivated to study more and learn more about this area of web development. I would like to express my thanks to Mayk Brito for all his work for the community, and may we see more incredible content like this in the future. :tada::tada:
